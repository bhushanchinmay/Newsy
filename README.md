# Welcome to [PinIdeas](https://newsy-606eb.web.app/)!:smiley:

This project was built as a personalized news tracker, to keep track of different articles and links, in a collaborative environment, where you and your friends, or anybody who wants to collaborate and share links can create an account on the application itself and share them. You can upvote and prioritize your links. It's like having extra helping hands:two_men_holding_hands: that keeps all your personalized news and links in one place. Its interface is pretty nice and simple with Minimalistic Design and having additional support for **Dark Theme** for greater visualization:sunglasses:.

## Course :book:

This project has been made with the help of the course **[Learn React by Building a Hacker News Clone](https://www.solidsail.com/courses/hacker-news/)** :iphone:

## Inspiration :innocent:

This project was made to gain knowledge about the implementations of React, Ionic and Firebase that can help build an application for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This project also gave me a deep insight into the working of Hooks, Validators, Authentication and all others. Overall it was a great experience in creating the application, it also helped me in learning about code modularity and taught me about Git and GitHub thus helping me create this project.
