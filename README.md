# Welcome to [Newsy](https://newsy-606eb.web.app/)!:smiley:

This project was made as a personalized news application, where you and your friends, or anybody who wants to collaborate and share links, by creating an individual accounts on the application itself and publishing afterwards. You can upvote and prioritize your links. Its like having an extra helping hands:two_men_holding_hands: which keeps all your personalized news and links at one place.  Its interface is pretty nice and clean with Minimalistic Design having an additional support for **Dark Theme** for greater visualization:sunglasses:.

## Course :book:

This project has been made with the help of the course **[Learn React by Building a Hacker News Clone](https://www.solidsail.com/courses/hacker-news/)** :iphone:

## Inspiration :innocent:

This project was made to gain knowledge about the implementations of React, Ionic and Firebase that can help build an application for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This project also gave me a deep insight into the working of Hooks, Validators, Authentication and all others. Overall it was a great experience in creating the application, it also helped me in learning about code modularity and taught me about Git and GitHub thus helping me create this project.
