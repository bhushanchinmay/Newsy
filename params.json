This project also gave me a deep insight into the working of Hooks, Validators, Authentication and all others. Overall it was a great experience in creating the application, it also helped me in learning about code modularity and taught me about Git and GitHub thus helping me create this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### About the Author :raising_hand_man:\r\n\r\n(@bhushanchinmay)\r\nI am Software Engineer:technologist:, Associate at Qualcomm Inc.
