<p>This project was made to gain knowledge about the implementations of React, Ionic and Firebase that can help build an application for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This project also gave me a deep insight into the working of Hooks, Validators, Authentication and all others. Overall it was a great experience in creating the application, it also helped me in learning about code modularity and taught me about Git and GitHub thus helping me create this project.</p>
